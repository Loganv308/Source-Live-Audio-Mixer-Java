# Source-Live-Audio-Mixer-Java
This repository is used for a recreation of SLAM (Source Live Audio Mixer) but in Java. The original was made with Visual Basic .NET.  

This is a work in progress. README.md, source code, and other parts of this application are subject to change and will be updated as development continues.
